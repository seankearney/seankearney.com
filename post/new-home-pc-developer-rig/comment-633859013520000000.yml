message: I would definitely go for two VelociRaptor's in RAID 0 as I would argue it is the single most noticeable performance improvement that you can generally do is increase your disk speed. Just build your machine in anticipation that it will die at any moment (which you should do anyway), with a good image and daily backups and you will be fine. I have been running RAID 0 on my main desktop's for the last 7 years and the rare occasion that you have a problem is worth the constant speed boost you get.
