message: I think I am one of the people who has made this request.  Personally, I think that TDS should support any content tree that Sitecore supports.  However, I think it would probably be better if Sitecore were to prohibit duplicate item paths.  They already have a validator for this, so I wouldn&#39;t think it would be too hard for them to make this a more critical failure.
