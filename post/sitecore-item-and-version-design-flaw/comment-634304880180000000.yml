  Interesting issue. I can see why Sitecore does it the way they do (as Brian describes above) and I have also witnessed the issue myself previously where an item existed but had no versions in any language. 


  I know you're after a discussion about how Sitecore should behave, but for anyone scratching their heads wondering how to work around this issue, simply verify the current item version has a created date. I'm not sure if that will work for the example above, but it worked in my case where an item didn't have a version in the current language.
