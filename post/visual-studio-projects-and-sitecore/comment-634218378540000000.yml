  Alex/Ivan,

  I can see some benefit to the approach you want to take, but I must ask if you work on a single site for your company or many sites for different clients, (or something else)? 


  In my experience I have many projects (clients) that have various components to their site. For instance, I have two projects that both rely on Coveo for search. I do not want to have Coveo running on my machine so I create a virtual machine that runs Sitecore and Coveo. When I build my project, from my workstation, the compiled code gets pushed to my VM and I debug. To make it more confusing, the Coveo version are different, therefore I have each client in their own virtual machine. If I took your approach I would need to have Visual Studio running in a VM and I would need to work in that VM via remote desktop.


  Ultimately it comes down to preference. Using virtual machines and Team Development for Sitecore I am able to code outside of the web root, leverage source control, have a development environment closely mirror my production environment, and do continuous integration. To me, that is the best way to work.
