message: I like the idea of working outside the webroot and we're doing this for umbraco projects aswell. But how do you handle changes done in Sitecore. Typically our developers would add new sublayouts through sitecore, to ensure database changes are done correctly. How do you handle that in a &quot;out of webroot&quot; project?
