  Okie,

  You should check out http://www.robotstxt.org/ to get an understanding of how the robots.txt file works. In short, it enables you to tell search engines what pages NOT to index. 


  You may also want to look into Google's Webmaster Tools:

  http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/


  That will allow you to tell what pages Google SHOULD index. It also provides a way to give descriptions to Google.
