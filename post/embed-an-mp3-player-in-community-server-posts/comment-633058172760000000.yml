message: I can't thank you enough. I realized that most of my MP3s had a sampling rate of 24 kHz and after changing them to 44.1kHz everything worked fine. The player is just what I have been looking for. It would be cool if you good get the title on the player to be customizable as opposed to defualting to the name of the MP3 file.
