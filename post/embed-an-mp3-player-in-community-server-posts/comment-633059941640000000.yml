message: I was  just looking at the MP3Player.txt file and noticed the url for the flash player. The player on that page is actually different than the one above. Is there anyway to switch players or at the very least hide the fake equalizer (it takes up a lot of space)? I've tried to do this myself, but I've failed miserably.
