With (almost) all of my FTP servers now running [FileZilla](http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/) I need a way to maintain users with an easy web based tool. To be more specific, I don't need it, but I delegate the management of FTP users to someone else who does not have remote access to the server, therefore I need it for them.

<!-- more -->

There has been mention of other people needing this type of functionality, and people mentioned there are php scripts out there, but I have yet to find one. Furthermore, being that I prefer ASP.NET development over any other I figured I would spend some time writing one of my own.

I will try to document my progress and post up the binary release when I am done.
