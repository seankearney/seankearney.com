message: "Hey Sean, I know my sister will mention it to you but if you get the chance, I would really appreciate if you showed me some of the ropes of teching. I think I can be a valuable asset to the floor. Chris Hoffman was showing me how to unjam the coin slots in the air hockey but it was during Dan Polis' shift and he got angry and took Chris off the floor and Ed was in the office with Shannon and then Terry the party office manager was made because the oven was broken and I had to use Dave Sauerers car to pick up the pizzas for the parties and Fudges' girlfriend the party host told Elisa in the snack bar that I was never going to be a tech and Eric Glaser said that wasn't true because Anthony Greene promised him a raise as soon as Billy Osullvian got a job with the Yankees but Brian and Artie couldn't decide who was going to be lazertron supervisor so it might just never happen.
