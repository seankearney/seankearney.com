![](twitter-bird-white-on-blue.png)[Dan Galvez](https://twitter.com/dgalvez01) and I had come up with an idea for a, sort of, Twitter based Sitecore [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Daily_Scrum). In essence, people would post on Twitter what they are doing today with the hashtag [#SitecoreScrum](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SitecoreScrum). Interestingly, another Sitecore developer ([Mike Reynolds](https://twitter.com/mike_i_reynolds)) started this exact same thing the very next day with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mike_i_reynolds/status/310036893557473280).  I've reached out to Mike and we are going to try and keep up with a daily #SitecoreScrum at 10am Eastern time. I don't know what will come of this, but it can't hurt knowing what others in our realm are doing with Sitecore.

I realize actually committing and sticking to these daily tweets is tough, but I would appreciate any Sitecore developer with a Twitter account to do it; it shouldn't take anyone too long to type 140 characters. 

If you use a multi-column Twitter client then take a moment and setup a column for the #SitecoreScrum search to keep tabs on one another! If the web interface is your thing, then setup a [saved search](https://support.twitter.com/articles/96646-how-to-save-searches). Alternatively, we can look to use a tool such as [http://taghuddle.com/sitecorescrum](http://taghuddle.com/sitecorescrum) to aggregate the hashtag.
