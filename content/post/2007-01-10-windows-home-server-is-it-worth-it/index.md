I am running a [Linksys NSLU2](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1119460471050&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper) with the [uNSLUng](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Unslung/HomePage) firmware with [TwonkyVision Media Server](http://www.twonkyvision.com/Products/TwonkyMedia/index.html) installed.  Attached to my NSLU is a standard external 300GB USB drive that holds my MP3s, movies, pictures, etc... On the home theater side of the equation I have the [D-Link DSM-520](http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&pid=438).

I must say, the setup is pretty simple and, in theory, it should be all I need. No PC needs to be on, I just need to leave my NAS device on and I should be able to fire up my DSM-520 and listen to my music. The problem is that the DSM can't find the uPNP media server unless it is freshly restarted. Once I start the DSM and then restart the NSLU I am good to go, but it is a bit of an annoyance to say the least.

Looking farther down the road... what happens when my USB drive takes a dump? I need to start looking at [RAID'ed NAS devices](http://infrant.com/products/products_details.php?name=ReadyNAS%20NV) to make sure I don't loose the pictures from my honeymoon! At this point, is it worth getting simply a NAS device? If I am going to be running a RAID NAS device, with a uPNP media server that costs close to $1000 is it worth it?

This new [Windows Home Server](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2079953,00.asp) is looking like a pretty good solution. Granted, everyone is hyped up over all the cool stuff coming out of CES 2007, but it still looks cool! If they can price this in the $500 range it will surely be a contender for me.
