  I just installed RAID into my media server. And I also have Twonky + DSM-320. I have tried MS Media Connect 2.0, MS Media Player 11 (Media Connect 3.9) and D-Link Media server. Twonky beats them all big way. It is fast and dont skip. It handles large collections (5000+ tracks) and hase very handy Artist Index, Album Index etc mode. I recommend Twonky to everybody.
