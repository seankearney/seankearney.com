I just want to rant a little about [Cablevision's IO HD DVR](http://www.optimum.com/io/dvr/dvr.jsp). The thing sucks! Sure, DVR's are great; when they work! I have been really busy every night working on the house and last night I quit early and wanted to catch up on last Thursday's episodes of "[My Name is Earl](http://www.nbc.com/My_Name_Is_Earl/)" and "[The Office](http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/)". Guess what. "The Office" didn't record for some unknown reason. *ARGH* Looking back over my recorded list I am seeing a few programs didn't get recorded. I am annoyed.

While I am on a Cablevision Rant... I hate having my bandwidth throttled. I am currently living in a co-op and [Verizon's FiOS](http://www.verizonfios.com/) isn't avaiable. You can be sure that when I move into my house I will be calling up verizon!
