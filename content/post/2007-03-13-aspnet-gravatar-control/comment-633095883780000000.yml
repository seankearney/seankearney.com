  Hi Dave,

  The Gravatar control isn't for Community Server. In order to make it work with CS I would need to modify the "Leave a Comment" form to store an email address and I don't see the point with CS 2007 hanging overhead.


  Now, with CS 2007 and Ben's nice Utility Controls we can hook this up without any core changes!


  This was just a silly 15 minute exercise to take my mind off my existing projects.
