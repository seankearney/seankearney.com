OK. So I have been in my house for a few weeks now, but I still don't have my home office setup the way I need it. I **really** need a hand trying to find a good desk that works well as a normal desk as well as a computer desk with my 2 monitors. The only real restrictions that I have is that:

<!-- more -->

1.  It needs to be at most 71" wide x 27" deep.
2.  I hate keyboard trays that look like center drawers! I am over 6'6" and my legs need all the room I can get.
3.  I would prefer a dark cherry wood

If all ten of [:P] my readers have a sweet setup at home, please send me links and pics!

Thanks.
