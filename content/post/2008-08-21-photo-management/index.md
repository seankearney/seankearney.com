I am running into a problem. I have never been much of a picture taking kind of guy... that is, until I got a dog and a son. Now I am snapping pictures like a mad man with my [Canon Xsi](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=16303) and amassing thousands of pictures named IMG_9321.jpg. I need help!!!!

<!-- more -->

I have my photos organized in a `X:\[year]\[month]\[event]` folder structure, but as time goes on I am forgetting what happened when. When my cat loving friends come over, I want to show them a picture of [Wilson](http://www.carknee.com/photos/carknee/tags/Wilson/default.aspx) eating the neighbors cat, but I can never find it. (joke)

I had tried [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) in the past and it looked promising. I am tempted to get the latest version and give it another shot, but I am wondering what my other options are. I did a little looking around and then started thinking... why not get a [mac](http://www.apple.com/mac/)? Did I really just think that?

I will surely try the free Picasa before jumping ship and spending $2k plus on a macbook pro, but that macbook may come in handy for, say, trying .net development?
