![](MovingOn.jpg)It is time for me to move on from my [current employer](http://www.ddc-web.com). I have been with this company since 2000 (with a brief stint elsewhere) and it is really time to go. As is the case with most developers, if you don't learn new things on a daily basis your job can get pretty boring. I tried to keep myself going here since, in general, it is a great company to work for, but I know I have to go. I believe that I have reached the limit to what I can learn on my own.

There are certain things that you can pick up much easier when you are working with a group of smart guys who like to share their knowledge. That being said, I am going to an application development company ([Hedgehog Development)](http://www.hhogdev.com) that specializes in [.NET](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx), [SiteCore](http://www.sitecore.com/), [SharePoint](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx), and [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx). They have some great projects already in the works and some good stuff down the pipe as well.
