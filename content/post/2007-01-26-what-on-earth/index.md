I was just browsing some spots on Google Maps and noticed some [pretty strange looking water](http://www.google.com/maps?q=Anchorage,+AK&ie=UTF8&z=9&ll=61.143235,-114.274292&spn=0.861633,3.47168&t=h&om=1)!

Anyone have any ideas? Is it just in some frozen state? Is there a nuclear power plant nearby?
