Big thanks to [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000825.html) for bringing this up! Being an ex-Internet Explorer user I have IE shortcuts etched into my brain. Unfortunately, FireFox didn't bring my favorite one with it. The functionality of the F4 key. 

<!-- more -->

In order to get to the Address bar in IE (without the mouse) you can press F4. I have longed for the FireFox equivalent, but couldn't quite remember it (and was too lazy to dig it up).

Thanks Jeff.
