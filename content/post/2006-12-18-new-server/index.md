In my first post, all of an hour ago, I mentioned that a new server was one of the reasons I renewed my interest in blogging.   

<!-- more -->

Just to give you an idea of what I was running:  
It was a "homemade" computer:  

- CPU: Celeron (2GHz maybe?)  
- RAM: Started at 512MB and was upgraded to 2GB (motherboard max)  
- Drives: 2x 40GB IDE drives running RAID 1  
- OS: Windows Server 2000   

That machine served me well! I made it for under $600 about 3 years ago and it worked great up until I started trying to run Community Server sites, DotNetNuke sites, etc... all of the ASP.NET Web applications really started bogging the machine down. I didn't see myself getting away from Community Server anytime soon, so it was time for an upgrade!  

Here are some specs of the new server:  

- Dell PowerEdge 2900  
- CPU: Dual Core Xeon Processor 5130 4MB Cache, 2.00GHz, 1333MHz FSB  
- RAM: 4GB @ 667MHz  
- OS Drives: 2x 36GB SAS, 15K RPM running RAID 1  
- Data Drives: 2x 300GB SAS, 10K RPM running RAID 1  
- OS: Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition  
    - Dual onboard Gb Ethernet   
    - Redundant power supplies
