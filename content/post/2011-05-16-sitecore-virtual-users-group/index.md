You might be interested to hear about a new initiative that Hedgehog Development is undertaking, the Sitecore Users' Virtual Group. This user group is dedicated to supporting the Sitecore community wherever they exist across the globe. We have some great speakers lined up for our first sessions, and we're looking forward to their deep expertise on Sitecore development. All sessions are free of charge and conducted over the web. The current schedule is at [http://www.sitecoreug.org](http://www.sitecoreug.org)
