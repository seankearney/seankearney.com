In my [last post](http://www.carknee.com/archive/2007/02/21/it-is-coming-to-a-head-now.aspx) I mentioned that I am moving into my new house. I am living amongst boxes right now, but I am in. No new pics yet, but I will take some when we are settled. Right now we are getting furniture delivered and unpacking slowly.

My desk, that I used in my old co-op, will not fit in my new office so I am without a home office right now. I have been "unplugged" at the house for over a week now, and I must say it is nice to go without being tethered to the computer at night. As nice as it is to be without Internet at home, I **need** to get back to checking my emails and administering some of my sites ([rswarrior.com](https://rswarrior.com) & [digitaldjpool.com](https://digitaldjpool.com)). To all the [rswarrior.com](https://rswarrior.com) vendors and members, sorry I have been very lax with email responses! I will be desk shopping this week and hopefully be next week I will be all setup at home.
