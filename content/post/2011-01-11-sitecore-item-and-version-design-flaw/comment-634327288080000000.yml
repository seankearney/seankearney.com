  Sean, hate to do this, but I could not find another way to contact you. In a previous post you spoke of the REST api for Sitecore, but in 6.4 it seems to have been eliminated. Do you know if it still exists via another path? If not, do you think taking that page from an old version of SiteCore and putting it into 6.4 might work?


  Thanks,
