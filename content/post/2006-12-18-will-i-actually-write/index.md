Will I actually write?  

<!-- more -->

I have tried this blogging thing once before and like many others it just fell to the wayside. Normal work and life take priority over blogging for me. I wish I had maintained a blog since I started one years ago, but now I am (semi) dedicated to maintaining this one. We will see how this one lasts!

So why the renewed interest in blogging? There are a couple reasons really.

1. I finally upgraded my web server to allow me to run another web site and database!
2. I wrote quite a few Community Server add-ons, CSModules, etc... and might like to share my experiences.
3. Just Community Server thoughts (and rants) that I would like to throw out there. 

Hopefully this will not be the last post I make.
