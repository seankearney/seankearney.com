  Hi Sean, Thanks! Your blog is great!  You've got yourself a new regular reader.


  So I just copied all that text into notepad to create a robots.txt file.  I am pretty technologically clueless - please bear with my very basic questions...So II just copy what you wrote exactly as it is?  The Number signs and all (####) ???


  Also, back to the feed problem and being listed in search engines.  The feeds are located on some of the same pages as I have content.  


  For example: 

  [TOP of PAGE]

  Original article titles, w/ links to the articles   

  [BOTTOM OF PAGE]

  Google feeds.  


  So how do exclude just that feed part of the page from being read? I just want it to read the site description you directed me to create in the control panel, and bring it up.
