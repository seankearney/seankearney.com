  @John,

  I would say that if I did what you did then I would probably do something like you have outlined; essentially a way to test out various things quickly.


  However, my issue is that the majority of people reading your blog aren't doing what you do. I would think the majority are working on their own &quot;in-house&quot; site, or, as in my case, many sites for many clients. Therefore, being that the majority probably aren't doing what you do, then they probably shouldn't work the way you do either.


  As for the dynamic compilation... it sounds like using the 'web site model' with Sitecore. Then maybe using web deploy projects you can compile that for production release. Interesting idea.
