message: Just noting that I read somewhere that Windows Azure requires the Web Application Project, though there are probably ways around that. I thought it was funny because Microsoft had removed that project model in the first release of Visual Studio 2005, but had to add it back with a service pack, included it in 2008, and appeared to make it mandatory for Azure in 2010.
