  Sean,


  How do you handle Sitecore module installs? It seems like after installing, you'd need them added to the base Sitecore &quot;image&quot; that all developers use, and that is used for deploying new environments. But then how do you isolate the &quot;image&quot; from the code deployed on top of it?


  Thanks,

  Nick
