  Sean,


  I couldn't agree with you more. I've been a long-time fan of working outside of the web root as well and using post-build scripts (MSBuild is crazy extensible) to copy files from the solution to the web root. 


  This approach [i]always[/i] results in cleaner solutions, easier code management, more efficient deployments and also smoother upgrades.
