  Sean,


  The method is designed to substitute the actual plain field value with a runtime value, that might not yet be saved to a Sitecore item.


  So using the OverrideFieldValue would make FieldRenderer function _as if_ Sitecore field contained that value. But it doesn't mean that it will be exactly what is displayed by the control.


  Good catch on the bug. To fix it I would (and I will) modify the GetFieldValue processor so that it is aware of overriden value, instead of adding a new one later on.


  Thanks for the report.
