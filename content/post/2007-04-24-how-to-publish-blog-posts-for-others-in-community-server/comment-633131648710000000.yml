message: "Hi Robert,\nThere is no queue or anything special with this. The way we are going to work it is that all submitted \"articles\" (blog posts) will be emailed to our Content Manager guy. His job will be to clean the article up and make the post as the original author.\n\nThe only change to the user interface would be an additional textbox on the \"Write a Blog Post\" page that allows you to enter in the username of the member who wrote the article.\n\nDoes that clear it up? "
