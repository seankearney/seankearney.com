This isn't an iPhone review blog post. There have been hundreds in the last hour since it was announced.

Wow. It has been about 16 months since the I [first wrote about the iPhone](/post/iphone) coming out; I still don't have one. I've read the reviews, played with it, and liked it, but as I wrote, I wasn't going to spend $400+ on a phone. For $199 (maybe cheaper with a 2 year contract) I'll take two please. For $200 you get a fully capable web browser, pocket GPS, email, camera, yada, yada, yada, and, oh yea. a phone too!

July 11th I  will finally get rid of my Razr!
