  I definitely applaud the use of NuGet for this scenario!


  Have you guys considered using MyGet.org for your NuGet needs? (disclaimer: I am one of the founders of MyGet)


  It sounds like our services might be a good fit for your needs, incl. a gallery where you can publish your feed, build services, support for upstream package sources (with support for feed credentials) and more. There&#39;s even an OSS plan.


  Feel free to reach out through https://www.myget.org/support
