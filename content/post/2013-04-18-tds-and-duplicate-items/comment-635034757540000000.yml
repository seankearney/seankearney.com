  The main reason I can think is that the stock, out-of-the-box Sitecore Core database contains duplicate item names (the dreaded Dividers), so just adding that tree in the first place requires painful manual renaming (and then it&#39;s no longer &quot;stock, out-of-the-box&quot;).


  It&#39;s bad from a user experience standpoint: your users&#39; very first sync with Core will throw up several error messages which require manual resolution, which is not a good first impression.
