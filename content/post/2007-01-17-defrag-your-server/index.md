It seems that my fancy dancy server needs to run defrag every couple days. The site is running a well visited site (and some other not so visited sites) and is creating 300MB Log Files from IIS, as well as user uploaded files, etc... All of this is really fragmenting my nice and speedy data drive (actually, 2 drives in a RAID 1 configuration).

I hear a lot about the Windows Defrag program is an outdated POS and that you should  consider using [DiskKeeper](http://www.diskeeper.com/diskeeper/standard/standard.asp)'s newer products. It seems reasonable since Diskeeper is constantly running making sure your files aren't fragmented, but is it worth the $300 MSRP?

Does anyone have any thoughts to this?  [tags:Server]
