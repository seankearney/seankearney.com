What [sad news](http://www.dmbnews.net/2008/08/leroi-moore-dead-at-46-saxophonist-was.html). LeRoi Moore, The [Dave Matthews Band](http://www.dmband.com/) saxophonist has died.

I have been a DMB fan since the mid ninetees when they first broke out and to be honest, they were **all** I listened to for many, MANY, years. I have slowly began to venture away from them over the last couple years, but to this day DMB rules my iPod. Being a sax player (although I haven't touched an axe in years) LeRoi was my favorite musician in the band. I have seen them in concert a few times and LeRoi's solos were always something to look forward to.

"LeRoi Moore on the saxophone"... no more. Sad.
