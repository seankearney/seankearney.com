I am posting this just as a teaser, and to force myself to keep to my word... I have other CS Add-Ons that I will try to release when I get time to package them up. I wrote a few good ones about 6 months ago and have yet to release them. My favorite of the bunch is a "Site Supporter Add-On!"

<!-- more -->

The Site Supporter add-on will allow donations to be made to you and you will then assign that person to a Role. The Add-On is extensible so you are not limited to PayPal either. It is along the lines of [Sean Winstead's Subscriber Add-On](http://www.seanwinstead.com/blogs/archive/2006/08/15/SHSubscriberBasicRequirements.aspx).

The main driver for me to write these add-ons is that I have been evaluating the migration of [www.rswarrior.com](http://www.rswarrior.com) from [Snitz](http://forum.snitz.com/) over to [Community Server](http://communityserver.org/). RSWarrior is pretty heavily modified and I would need at least some of the core features in order to move over to Community Server. A big part of RSWarrior is the "Site Supporter" status that members can have. I needed to duplicate that feature and the answer was my "Site Supporter Add-On."

Some other Add-ons I have written for the new (pending) RSWarrior.com is a Links manager and Photo Gallery extender.

Stay tuned ;)
