Almost two years after I thought about [phasing out my online moniker](/post/what-is-in-a-name) I have done it. I have officially moved the carknee.com domain to seankearney.com. Redirects are in place and there shouldn't be any noticable change for the few people that read this site. The Feedburner feed is unchanged and will remain unchanged for the near future. Maybe at some point I will move to rss.seankearney.com, but not yet.
